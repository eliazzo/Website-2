I speak Spanish and have attempted French on various occasions. I love to travel and have visited Europe, Latin America and most recently, East Africa. I was lucky enough to live in Seville for 6 months as part of my Spanish studies. \n\n When a friend spoke to me about his journey to becoming a web developer, I was intrigued but felt my background had no relation to coding. However, when he started to talk about functions and expressions, I was reminded of the Formal Semantics I studied in the final year of my linguistics degree. We studied boolean logic and used existential (∆é) and universal (·óÑ) quantifiers to translate sentences. We then moved on to use the lambda (ùõå) function to develop a set of lexical translation rules for English lexemes. \n\n For example,";

Learning brings me great joy and if education was free I could happily spend the rest of my life moving from degree to degree. I often thought about (and still think about) applying for a masters. However, while I am thrilled to have the skills to analyse and critique the use of the Supernatural in Latin American fiction, or translate English lexemes using lamda expression (among other, obscure skills), I am hesitant to pursue more education without a definitive end goal. That's where Founders and Coders comes in. Since joining the FAC community I have rediscovered a space where peer learning and support is at it's core. I am delighted with the prospect of a career that involves daily research and learning. Joining FAC would enable me to continute my education, learn a multitude of new skills and provide me with an exciting career path - all of which I am currently searching for!";
