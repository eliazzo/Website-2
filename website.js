My degree was evenly split between Spanish and Linguistics. I studied hispanic literature, film, history and politics alongside, of course, the language itself. Similarly, Linguistics was very broad and my studies included psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and formal semantics, which has roots in logic and the philosophy of language.";

I tutor small groups of GCSE students with a particular focus on English Language. I also support students with additional learning needs, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder. The school has many students who speak English as a second language and I provide support to some of the Spanish speaking students.";

document.getElementById("language-text").innerText = "I have a passion for languages and had the privilege of immersing myself in the study of linguistics during my four years at Manchester. I speak Spanish and have attempted French on various occasions. I love to travel and have visited Europe, Latin America and most recently, East Africa. The gallery section above displays some images taken in Rwanda this summer, where I co-lead a team researching the impact of a local businesses community work. I was lucky enough to live in Seville for 6 months as part of my Spanish studies. \n\n When a friend spoke to me about his journey to becoming a web developer, I was intrigued but felt my background had no relation to coding. However, when he started to talk about functions and expressions, I was reminded of the formal semantics I studied in the final year of my linguistics degree. Formal semantics draws upon logic and theoretical computer science to study grammatical meaning in natural language. We studied propositional and predicate logic and used existential (∆é) and universal (·óÑ) quantifiers to translate sentences. We later used the lambda (ùõå) function to develop a set of lexical translation rules for English lexemes. For example, \n";

document.getElementById("language-text-continued").innerText = "It was difficult at first, and unlike anything I had studied previously. But I enjoy problem solving, and after breaking down the process into smaller sections it became very manageable. For many reasons, the journey I underwent to understand predicate logic has given me the confidence to pursue a career in coding."
document.getElementById("learning-text").innerText = "I loved being an undergraduate. Learning brings me great joy and if money were no object I could easily spend the rest of my life moving from degree to degree. I have often considered continuing my education with a masters. However, while I thoroughly enjoyed analysing and critiquing the use of the Supernatural in Latin American fiction, or translating English lexemes into predicate logic, I am hesitant to pursue more education without a decided end goal. \n\n That's where Founders and Coders come in! Since joining the FAC community I have rediscovered a community where peer learning and support is paramount. I am delighted with the prospect of a career that involves daily learning. Joining FAC would enable me to learn a multitude of new skills and help me to build a network so I can enter into a career in web development.";
